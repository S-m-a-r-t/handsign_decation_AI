# handsign_decation_AI
An AI-based system that detects hand signs (A–Z, 0–9) via webcam and converts them into speech in real time using deep learning.


# ✋ My Hand Sign Detection AI 🤖🗣️

A real-time AI system that detects hand signs (A–Z, 0–9) and converts them into readable text and spoken words using deep learning and computer vision.

## 🚀 Overview

This project aims to help individuals with speech or hearing impairments communicate easily by translating static hand gestures into voice output using a webcam, a deep learning model (MobileNetV2), and a text-to-speech engine.

## 📌 Features

- Real-time hand sign detection using webcam
- Recognition of A–Z and 0–9 hand gestures
- Text and voice output using TTS
- Lightweight and fast (MobileNetV2)
- Works with custom black-and-white image datasets

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Model:** MobileNetV2 (Keras/TensorFlow)
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow, pyttsx3
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- **Dataset:** Custom hand sign images (A-Z, 0-9), already sorted into train/test folders
